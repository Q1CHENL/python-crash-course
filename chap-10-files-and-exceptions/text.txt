_To You Who Read My Book_


  Soon every sprinter,
    However fleet,
  Comes to a winter
    Of sure defeat:
  Though he may race
    Like the hunted doe,
  Time has a pace
    To lay him low.

  Soon we who sing,
    However high,
  Must face the Thing
    We cannot fly.
  Yea, though we fling
    Our notes to the sun,
  Time will outsing
    Us every one.

  All things must change
    As the wind is blown;
  Time will estrange
    The flesh from the bone.
  The dream shall elude
    The dreamer’s clasp,
  And only its hood
    Shall comfort his grasp.

  A little while,
    Too brief at most,
  And even my smile
    Will be a ghost.
  A little space,
    A Finger’s crook,
  And who shall trace
    The path I took?

  Who shall declare
    My whereabouts;
  Say if in the air
    My being shouts
  Along light ways,
    Or if in the sea,
  Or deep earth stays
    The germ of me?

  Ah, none knows, none,
    Save (but too well)
  The Cryptic One
    Who will not tell.

  This is my hour
    To wax and climb,
  Flaunt a red flower
    In the face of time.
  And only an hour
    Time gives, then snap
  Goes the flower,
    And dried is the sap.

  Juice of the first
    Grapes of my vine,
  I proffer your thirst
    My own heart’s wine.
  Here of my growing
    A red rose sways,
  Seed of my sowing,
    And work of my days.

  (I run, but time’s
    Abreast with me;
  I sing, but he climbs
    With my highest C.)

  Drink while my blood
    Colors the wine,
  Reach while the bud
    Is still on the vine....

  Then ...
    When the hawks of death
  Tear at my throat
    Till song and breath
  Ebb note by note,
    Turn to this book
  Of the mellow word
    For a singing look
  At the stricken bird.

    Say, “This is the way
  He chirped and sung,
    In the sweet heyday
  When his heart was young.
    Though his throat is bare,
  By death defiled,
    Song labored there
  And bore a child.”

  When the dreadful Ax
    Rives me apart,
  When the sharp wedge cracks
    My arid heart,
  Turn to this book
    Of the singing me
  For a springtime look
    At the wintry tree.

  Say, “Thus it was weighed
    With flower and fruit,
  Ere the Ax was laid
    Unto its root.
  Though the blows fall free
    On a gnarled trunk now,
  Once he was a tree
    With a blossomy bough.”
